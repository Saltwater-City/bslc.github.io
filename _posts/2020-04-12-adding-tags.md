I am using this blog to organize my own thoughts. Tags on the posts would be helpful in this regard. Unfortunately, the Jekyll theme I like <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon/pull/85">will not support support tags out of the box</a>. I used this opportunity to learn a bit more about Jekyll and webpages. To add tags to your Jekyll based page, you can follow Long Qian's excellent <a href="https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/">step-by-step guide</a>. 

While the guide worked perfectly, I found that there was a lag between pushing changes to Github and the changes being displayed on the web. To iterate faster, I installed Jekyll locally using this <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/">guide</a> and followed this help page on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/">Github</a> to render it locally.
