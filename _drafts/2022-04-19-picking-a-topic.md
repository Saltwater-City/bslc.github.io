## Picking the Topic

First and foremost, I always advise my mentees to pick a topic that is important to them on a personal level. In comparison to the standard topics that can be found on Kaggle and other data science focused sites, there are several advantages:

### 1\. Originality

Anyone who has been around data science long enough would have seen Twitter sentiment analysis or classifying images of cats and dogs couple dozen of times. I am personally tired of seeing the same old capstone projects over and over again. While one could always put a new spin on an old topic, this is a difficult task for an inexperienced data scientist.

On the other hand, a topic of personal interest is unlikely to be a retread of the tired old themes in data science. Given fierce competition in the data science job market, any opportunity to stand out from the crowd is good.  As I mentioned in the previous section, the purpose of the capstone project is to hone and show off the data science skills. Without constraints from prior works, one could explore the topic freely using any technique and thus able to show off one's best self. 

### 2\. Passion 

In all the data science interviews that I have been involved in, both as an interviewee and as an interviewer, there was always a presentation component. It can be difficult to make these presentations engaging because the content are mostly determined by industry standards. In each presentation, one must include an introduction of the topic and the data set, an exploratory data analysis, a statistical or machine learning model, and finally an analysis of the results from the model. Given the mechanical nature of these presentations, a personal passion on the topic will shine through. Actually caring about the topic would inject excitement that is not commonly found and this small difference can make this presentation stand out from other interview presentations.

### 3\. Expertise

As a burgeoning data scientist, one is unlikely to be the expert on the typical capstone project during the interview process. In fact, the interviewers would likely have more expertise on both the topic and the techniques involved. In my experience, it is difficult to present to people who know more than me. If the topic is of personal interest and outside of the typical data science topics, at least one could speak with authority on the topic. 

Aside from picking a topic of personal interest, the topic involved should also be of *business* interest to some *stakeholder*. After all, like every other employee of a company, a data scientist's work should add value to the company. While simple at first glance, the ideas of business interest and stakeholders can be difficult to define and these topics will be covered in a separate post in the future.
