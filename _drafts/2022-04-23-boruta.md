### A Common Question 
- many features that make up a model
- of these features, which ones are important? 
- often use the feature importance in random forest algorithm to determine 
- the numbers at the end are not actually meaningful (see...)

- Boruta is an algorithm that can provide some context to the problem

### How does the algorithm work? 

### A Toy Example

### Final Thoughts
