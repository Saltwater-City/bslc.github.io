## Picking the Data Set

Of the many components that make up data science, employers tend to focus on machine learning more than other disciplines. After picking the topic, we need to search for a corresponding data set that would help show off machine learning skills. To facilitate machine learning, a data set with many records and relatively few attributes, i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data#Narrow">a narrow data set</a> is preferred. While a larger data set is preferred in machine learning in general, data set can be too large and impede progress. Available computational power will become an issue and it would be difficult to iterate in the project. Until one is comfortable in using big data tools, such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, one should avoid data set that is too large to fit into memory. While <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is the obvious first tool for finding a data set that fit all the criteria listed in this post, tips and tricks on finding the data set will be covered in a future post.
